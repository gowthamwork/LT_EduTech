1. AIM OF THE PROJECT

    The aim of this project is to predict heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms

2. UNIQUENESS/DIFFERENTIATOR TRIED OUT IN THE PROJECT

    SVM model has been tried as a new methodology with existing model

3. INFERENCE
    
    The tried out SVM model has less accuracy (0.74) than the Random forest classifier (0.79)
